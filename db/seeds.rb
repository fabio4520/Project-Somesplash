# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)


# Seed one category

# puts "Start seeding"
# category = Category.create(
#   name: "Wallpapers", 
#   description: "From epic drone shots to inspiring moments in nature, find free HD wallpapers worthy of your screens."
# )
# category.cover.attach(io: "https://i.imgur.com/9v9zVYy.png", filename: "wallpaper_cover.png")
# puts "Finish seeding"
